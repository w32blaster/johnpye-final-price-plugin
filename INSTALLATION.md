## Testing the Extension

1. Navigate to a John Pye auction lot details page:
   `https://www.johnpyeauctions.co.uk/Event/LotDetails/[lot-number]/[lot-name]`

2. The extension should automatically:
   - Detect the minimum bid amount
   - Find the delivery cost
   - Calculate and display the final price
   - Show a green box with the calculation

3. Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to:
   - See the current status

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing
- Make sure you selected the correct folder (`dist/chrome` or `dist/firefox`)
- Check the browser's extension management page for error messages
- Verify that the `manifest.json` file is present in the selected folder

### No Price Calculation Showing
1. Check that you're on a John Pye lot details page
2. Open browser console (F12) and look for debug messages
3. Try clicking the extension icon and use the "Refresh" button
4. The page structure might have changed - see "Advanced Troubleshooting" below

### Permission Denied Errors
- The extension should automatically request permissions for `https://www.johnpyeauctions.co.uk/*`
- If prompted, click "Allow" to grant the necessary permissions

## Advanced Troubleshooting

If the extension can't find price information, you can analyze the page structure:

1. Navigate to a John Pye lot details page
2. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `site-analyzer.js` from this project
4. Press Enter to run the analysis
5. Copy the console output and use it to update the selectors in `src/content.js`

## Development Mode

For ongoing development:

1. Make changes to files in the `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to rebuild
3. Go to your browser's extensions page
4. Click the "Reload" button for the extension
5. Refresh any John Pye pages you have open
